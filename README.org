* Installation
Run the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git clone https://github.com/InkBrownell/vyrindar-notes
cd vyrindar-notes
npm install
#+END_SRC

This project also depends on Emacs with the ~ox-publish~ package.

* Building
This project is essentially a static site generator which uses Org files as a backend.
Yes, it's jank. Yes, it requires Emacs in the build process. The point is that it works.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
npm run build
#+END_SRC

This will place the static files in the ~dist/~ directory.

* Publishing
The project is set up so you can update Github Pages with an NPM command. This will 
build and then publish the project.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
npm run publish
#+END_SRC
